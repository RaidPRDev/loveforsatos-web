# LoveForSatos
> This web app was created for a non-profit organization -> Love For Satos https://love4satos.squarespace.com/

## Description
> The idea was to give the organizer, the ability to catalog rescued dogs in Puerto Rico.  Once this is done, the organizer would be able to send electronic lists to other dog rescue organizations in other countries.  These organizations can then select or promise the dogs which would notify the organizer.
